# Can machine learning techniques help predict how teams will draft in the 2016 NFL draft?

### draft_predictions.ipynb: 

An iPython notebook with some preliminary data analysis to explore whether a team's performance in the previous season influences who they select in the first round of following the NFL draft. The notebook looks at two key features: total yards, and total yards allowed, and sorts teams by rank. If a team finishes the season ranked 12th in total offense and 20th in total defense, will they select someone on offense or defense?

#### Models used:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine

### draft_experts.ipynb

An iPython notebook which features a similar methodology using different input data. Namely, "epxert" mock drafts. Ten years of mock drafts from ESPN (McShay when available, Kiper in some spots), Bleacher Report, and walterfootball.com. All data was taken from the mock draft closest to the actual draft.
