# Can machine learning techniques help predict how teams will draft in the 2016 NFL draft?

## draft_predictions.ipynb: 

An iPython notebook with some preliminary data analysis to explore whether a team's performance in the previous season influences who they select in the first round of following the NFL draft. The notebook looks at two key features: total yards, and total yards allowed, and sorts teams by rank. If a team finishes the season ranked 12th in total offense and 20th in total defense, will they select someone on offense or defense?

### Models used:
